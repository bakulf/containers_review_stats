Though execution suc*s!\n\nExample: while the initial premise of being able to create separate accounts for separate purposes kinda works, the extension doesn't seem to be able to store bookmarks in their related containers. As soon as I close & reopen Firefox the containers are once again empty, and I need to re-research for the sites I was looking for. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be an option to drag n drop existing (or new) bookmarks to related containers. Guess we gotta wait for an AI, or otherwise intelligent, solution.\n\nWould be a great extension if it would offer an intuitive way to bookmark & save sites into relevant containers (and keep them there after closing FF).\n\nThen again, I probably didn‚Äôt get the initial purpose of this extension, and might be looking in the wrong place, or perhaps I just don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs it trying to offer.

Manage personal and work emails, or different social media profiles, side-by-side without needing separate browsers or private windows.\n- Intuitive Control:¬†Easily assign websites to specific containers. Once set up, sites automatically open in their designated container, keeping your browsing neatly compartmentalized with minimal effort.\n- Trustworthy & Integrated:¬†Developed directly by Mozilla, it's free, open-source, and seamlessly integrates with the Firefox browser, ensuring reliability and adherence to privacy principles.\n- Clean Browsing:¬†Stop juggling multiple browser profiles or constantly logging in and out. Containers provide a streamlined and efficient way to manage your diverse online life.\n\nThat's it!

For example: If I open a  Shopping container on Amazon, then another Shopping container for Ebay, can the 2 sites share information with each other and profile me? \n\nI tried looking for this question and answer online but came up empty handed. So to be on the safe side one would have to make a separate container for EVERY site they want to keep isolated. That includes separating domains from sub domains. \n\nSecond: Sites that I have assigned to containers don't automatically open in said containers. Navigating to the site via the address bar produces a message asking how I want to open the site. Selecting the \"Remember my decision for this site\" option does nothing, but perhaps that is due to my Firefox settings or other extensions that block cookies and trackers. You would think though that Firefox would make this extension compatible with their built in privacy options.\n\nThird: It takes multiple steps/clicks to remove a site you accidentally add to a container. For me the \"Manage Extension\" button is cut off (regardless of how zoomed in or not I am) so it took me even longer than others probably to figure it out.\n\nMany people seem to love this extension but frankly there's got to be a better, more hands off approach to stopping sites from tracking and profiling you. If you aren't looking to have every domain and sub domain separate maybe try it, but I will be looking at other options.","created":"2024-03-17T18:24:07Z","score":2},{"body":null,"created":"2024-03-18T15:16:13Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2024-03-20T09:09:29Z","score":1},{"body":"–ê—Ö—É–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –∫—Ç–æ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç –ø–æ –∞–±—É–∑–∏—Ç—å –∏ –Ω–∞–µ–±–∞—Ç—å –ø–∞—Ä—É –¥–µ—Å—è—Ç–∫–æ–≤ —Å–∞–π—Ç–æ–≤, —Å–º–µ–ª–æ –∫–∞—á–∞–π—Ç–µ —ç—Ç—É –ø–æ–µ–±–æ—Ç—É, —Ä–µ—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–∞–º","created":"2024-03-20T15:31:29Z","score":5},{"body":"Have used this extension for a while now & use it as one of my attempts to keep Google & Facebook etc., from accessing my information as much as is possible.","created":"2024-03-21T12:28:40Z","score":5},{"body":"–û—á–µ–Ω—å –∫—Ä—É—Ç–æ! –ü–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –∞–∫–∫–∞—É–Ω—Ç—ã... –¢–∞–∫ –∂–µ –∂–¥—É –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∏ –≤–∞—à–µ–≥–æ VPN –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏... –ü–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –ø–æ–∫–∞ 4...","created":"2024-03-22T15:59:20Z","score":4},{"body":null,"created":"2024-03-23T13:04:53Z","score":5},{"body":"must-have","created":"2024-03-25T00:00:52Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2024-03-25T10:23:50Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2024-03-25T17:17:34Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2024-02-21T18:31:08Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2024-02-21T19:35:07Z","score":1},{"body":null,"created":"2024-02-21T20:19:40Z","score":5},{"body":"great idea & a simple way of improving user experience on Firefox but the best feature that can be added is the possibility to group tabs of the same container in the top tab bar","created":"2024-02-23T00:04:01Z","score":3},{"body":null,"created":"2024-02-23T14:29:45Z","score":5},{"body":"Nice addon, but it does not work with Google Admin (https://admin.google.com/) and Google Photos (https://photos.google.com).

It'd be nice if we could whitelist add-ons to have access to relevant containers, but most users would probably want all of their add-ons to have full access to all of their containers by default and wouldn't expect them to be functionally blocked as they are.\n\nSecondly, containers don't nicely handle redirects. A lot of sites, especially corporate ones, will redirect through several different domains and subdomains when performing the login process. Containers set to \"Limit to Designated Sites\" won't operate correctly with these redirects as the redirect pages are not true web pages and don't allow you to sit on them long enough to click the address bar button to always open them in the specified container. This cannot currently be remedied by having foreknowledge of the complete list of redirect sites, as the \"Limit to Designated Sites\" list cannot be manually edited or appended outside of the limited address bar button method.\n\nThirdly, The VPN integration isn't particularly secure in premise. Being a per-container opt-in means that entities snooping on the line will immediately see that there's something suspiciously different in the data packets coming from your protected containers compared to the rest of your typical https encrypted traffic. This makes isolating these packets, on the fly, infuriatingly trivial. Making this a per-container opt-out would all but eliminate this problem, as attackers would have to have foreknowledge of the originating container to do this effectively in all circumstances. It'd also be great to see connection protocol options ( OpenVPN, WireGuard, etc. ) as well as other VPN provider options as that'd make it that much harder to try and figure out what's going on in the encrypted container traffic and would better protect Mozilla VPN itself. Right now it's technically more secure to not use the VPN feature at all.\n\nI think the basic idea here is really excellent, but these problems really do drag it down. Something made and maintained by Mozilla shouldn't have this many problems. I still think this is potentially useful to certain technical professionals trying to isolate their sensitive internal sites from other web apps, but the average user is going to have too many headaches to be able to use this effectively. \n\nIf you know what you're doing, keep the above points in-mind and go ahead and give it a try.\n\nAnyone else? Hope Mozilla addresses some of these issues in a future release. I'll update my review if they do.","created":"2022-07-10T02:59:31Z","score":2},{"body":"Best extension, just use this extension with an adblock and you won't need anything else!","created":"2022-07-10T03:45:59Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2022-07-10T10:23:16Z","score":5},{"body":"so good. no need for more profiles. just make a new container and there you go","created":"2022-07-10T12:02:00Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2022-07-10T18:29:13Z","score":5},{"body":"Esta funci√≥n es lo mejor que tiene Firefox y por la que sigo usando el navegador, totalmente perfecta y util","created":"2022-07-11T16:01:43Z","score":5},{"body":"Es una herramienta muy pr√°ctica.

Alas, that shorthand doesn't work across containers, so it gets close to useless unless the searched-for tab resides in the same container with the current tab. In order to search for any other open tab, you (1a) first need to remember its context container, then (1b) find an arbitrary tab belonging to that container, then (1c) perform the tab search there. \n\n(2) Even with the \"sort tabs by container\" menu item (which has to be invoked manually each time), the visual overview provided by the thin colour marks at tabs is limited. The UI would be much clearer if containers were, or optionally could be, assigned to browser windows, making all tabs in that container appear in the associated window and nowhere else. \n\nThis (2) would also help a lot in dealing with (1), as finding a tab belonging to a particular container (1b) would be as easy as finding the corresponding browser window. Given that you typically use much fewer browser windows than tabs, even (1a) is not a big deal anymore as you can perform the tab search once in every browser window (i. e. container).","created":"2022-02-24T23:42:00Z","score":3},{"body":null,"created":"2022-02-25T07:02:17Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2022-02-25T12:24:42Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2022-02-27T02:33:01Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2022-02-27T03:48:45Z","score":5},{"body":"Great for working with multiple accounts, especially in a Public Cloud context.

It's a MASSIVE pain! Similarly, if you put eBay in one container and PayPal in another, you won't be able to make purchases anymore because you can't log into PayPal through eBay. ü§¶\n\n‚Ä¢ Likewise, there's no way to use wildcards or container-ize subdomains, so you have to add them all manually. For example, you can't put ALL StackExchange sites (*.stackechange.com) in a container together, you have to manually visit each one individually, then do the multiple clicks and mouse-movements to set it to open \"always in se container\". And then, you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN for each one's meta subdomain. ü§¶ Not only is it a massive pain, but it also defeats the point to containers since SE can track you via all the other sites that aren't in a container, including drive-by one-off SE sites you might find yourself on where you don't even have an account. ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶\n\n‚Ä¢ I temporarily disabled the addon to try to debug an issue with a site, and when I re-enabled it, ALL of its settings were gone, all the containers, all the assignments, everything. Worse, restoring the containers from a backup doesn't help because it already WIPED OUT ALL THE COOKIES! üò† Apparently this has been a bug for a long time and they STILL haven't fixed it.

(Maybe Firefox suspiciously treats this site in a different way at a base level. ü§î)\n\n‚Ä¢ The interface is extremely lacking. There is no way to directly edit the settings such as a text-box to enter domains to assign containers. The only way to do so is to actually go to a site and then assign it to a container. This has numerous problems:\n  ‚ó¶ It allows a site to track you at least once before you assign it to a container.\n  ‚ó¶ It doesn't work if you're offline.\n  ‚ó¶ It doesn't work if the site redirects to another domain or even subdomains (eg www.), so it can harvest data and quickly redirect, passing the data and preventing you from assigning the original domain to a container.

Excellent for both security and privacy. Just a couple of points keeping it from 5 stars:\n\n1st: We need an option so that all tabs set to open in a container by default won't prompt the user to ask if they want to open a link in its assigned container. It should just do it.\n\n2nd: \"The Manage Site List...\" menu needs an option to manually enter a web address. Currently the only option is to use the address bar button while navigating, but this can break some re-direct heavy sites. Slack logins, for instance, may go through several different corporate domains in an instant and will break in horribly painful ways if one of those URLs isn't allowed to open in the container holding the login cookie.\n\n3rd: Mozilla VPN is a good idea, but its implementation would be less vulnerable to traffic profiling attacks if it were on by default on all containers and each individual container had a separate opt-out option instead of the current enable option. I'd also like if the service weren't tied to specific Firefox accounts, or had a multi-account payment plan, so that I could use it on my work and home accounts at the same time.\n\n4th: This is just a wish-list thing, but I'd absolutely adore it if you allowed us to use third party VPN logins instead of Mozilla VPN. This would be really great for tunneling into VPNs tied to router networks in the home or at work as if the user were physically on location. A lot of companies do this for security and including this could really help adoption.\n\nAddress at least the first three of these and you'll get five stars!","created":"2021-12-06T20:28:46Z","score":4},{"body":null,"created":"2021-12-07T08:29:25Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2021-12-07T09:16:52Z","score":5},{"body":"Awesome to separate your buying from banking etc.","created":"2021-12-07T11:30:12Z","score":5},{"body":"Such a useful extension.

You can sync containers created in Firefox running on Linux with other Linux installations, and you can sync containers created in Firefox running on Windows with other Windows installations. But sync across OSes, and you'll wind up with two independent sets of containers synced to the same account.\n\nAnother example: the extension frequently spams dozens if not hundreds of additional containers.

I have test users with their roles on site. For each user I created an individual container. 6 roles require 6 pages to be restored every time I reload the browser. I want them be restored automatically in their respective container at the time when the Bookmark was created. One site, several bookmarks with individual containers for each test user/role.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW 2 years ago\nI used to open Chrome for one Google account and Firefox for another. To check business emails on Gmail and to view videos on YouTube, for example. It consumed quite a lot of resources on my old Dell Vostro 3700. Now, I can manage all my \"personas\" in Firefox alone, which I personally like more. \n\nBut, the new \"problem\" now is it's hard to find necessary tab on Windows task panel. So, I suggest, that not only individual tabs can be marked as containers, but every FireFox window could be assigned a default \"persona\" with different coloring and EVEN logo (I like the Fox, but sometimes it'd be useful to have those personalized icons to faster localize necessary tabs). PS. I use A LOT OF tabs (up to 50 in one session, I guess). So, saving time trying to locate a necessary tab would be cool.\nOn the whole, this is a really cool feature which is worth taking time to understand how to use. Firefox, please make a new button - Learn the Feature - so that it would be like an ed course with games, videos and tests (reading is boring and confusing, as you know).","created":"2020-05-15T09:11:04Z","score":4},{"body":null,"created":"2020-05-15T11:06:23Z","score":5},{"body":"Almost perfect!

I no longer use different browsers to contain my different accounts & sessions.\n\nFeature Asks / Ideas\n* Is it possible to create a key command for opening new container tabs? Maybe 1 Key commend command + shift + T which opens a window to select a container by number (1-personal, 2-work, etc). Note, this is a solution while the actual user need/job to address is making it easy and quick to open the container that I want without having to click into a window to select it. Opening tabs is such a frequent action that reducing even 1 click would rule.\n\n* Is it possible to map a single website to multiple containers? For example, gmail can be mapped to personal and work. Instead of locking it to just personal. That way, I open the right container, and then just type in gmail.com and go, no need to double check with me. The user opening a specific container means they know which session they want to run.\n\nThanks so much Moz Team!!! :)","created":"2020-05-15T18:38:07Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2020-05-16T22:25:47Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2020-05-17T17:05:18Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2020-05-07T14:14:53Z","score":4},{"body":"Way Better Than Chrome!

By default firefox opens with no default container.  This means you have to open a new tab in the correct container, before you start browsing, then close the original tab.  \n2. If you use the keybord shortcut to open a container, it does not prompt you to choose a container, it opens an uncontainerized tab, forcing you to either reopen the tab in the correct container, or use the + in the bar, which is significantly slower from a workflow point of view.\n3.  You cannot set home pages per container.   By default, my \"work\" container (for my company) always accesses the same site, with all tools launched through that site.  If i could set that as the home page for my work container, then it would save me a dozen clicks and keyboard presses 30-40 times a day.  Add that time up.\n4.  You cannot assign a book marked site to a container,  as above this would vastly improve matters.  THis would make the Top sites useful, as clicking them would immediately take you to the site in the correct container, likewise would mean technical research would be faster as you would not have to open the correct container by clicking the +, then choosing the container, then selecting the bookmark.\n5.  Turn off the No Container option.  Now I'm using containers, all my workflow fits into one of the configured containers, so the no container option is obsolete.\n6.  Make the option to Sort tabs by container a permanent setting, rather than a one off setting.  I end up using this option several times a day to regroup related sites running in the same container together for organisation, but it's frustrating that as soon as I open a new tab of that container it doesn't group this with the other tabs open.","created":"2020-04-16T09:26:49Z","score":4},{"body":null,"created":"2020-04-16T13:41:14Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2020-04-16T18:49:20Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2020-04-16T20:59:52Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2020-04-16T22:00:16Z","score":4},{"body":"Incredibly useful !!

But there's a few things that keep it down for me\n1) Lack of wildcard subdomain support is a killer. I read the issue on the subject and it seems there's privacy concerns with that. But the fact is that all the big sites you'd really want to confine to a container use subdomains constantly and often so it makes it frustratingly difficult to actually confine a site like google to its own container.\n2) I could probably live with #1 if there was a way to tell the extension to open the current site in a specified container in the future. Right now it appears you have to copy the url, use the extension to make a tab in the desired container, revisit the site and then tell it to stay there. That's a whole lot of steps for something you're going to have to do all the time without wildcard subdomain support.\n3) Once you're in a container, all navigation done from websites in that container remain in that container. So for instance, if I put google in a container and then click a link the search result, that link opens in the same container. This completely undermines the point for me, I can't actually use this to keep a site from tracking me unless I go put every single site on the internet in its own box manually. That's entirely too much effort, especially given the difficulty of actually putting a site in its own container (see #2)\n\nI'm giving this 3 stars and will probably keep using it because it is still convenient as a multi-session tool. Going to the same site in multiple sessions is something I have to do for work a lot so it is handy for that. But I'm hoping it evolves because it could be quite a lot more if they made it easier to just completely containerize the sites of your choice.","created":"2020-03-23T02:17:58Z","score":3},{"body":"nice tool!!!  but i need more colors!!! ;)","created":"2020-03-23T10:22:09Z","score":5},{"body":"really useful if you work with multiple \"profile\", also this extension is really light.

You'll open your Social Media tab, go to the site, log in, then check \"Always open in Social Media\". But then the next time you navigate to the site via URL or bookmark, it will open in the standard container because the rule was made for the signed-in redirected URL, not the original URL.

When opening a site in a container (e.g. Bing-search) - clicking a link - the new (unassigned) site will stay in the same container thus enabling tracking. Pretty useless this way. Although useful for using different profiles, it's not secure/private.\n\nOptions to add (user-decided behavior):\n- Open new unassigned sites in the default container, a temporary container or current container (you can reassign later)\n- Switch/assign (via toolbar button) the current site to different container (assign/move/copy to a new container for site)\n- Changing to a new container will open a new tab or use the current tab (a new tab to avoid losing *cursing* history)\n- Option to open web sites in their own containers without the user assigning a container (auto-created for TLD's) *\n- Possibility to select a default container for a site assigned to multiple containers or use last container used\n- Possibility to sort container labels\n- Add an overview of which site/data is contained in which container\n- Try to also use the omni-box for extra functions (assigned container switching) since the container-label is already there\n \n* When reassigned by user the auto-created container is renamed or merged with an existing container\n\nEDIT 1: Rating lowered from 2 to 1 star until problems are solved. Totally wrong implementation (the omni-box becoming useless and is imprisoned by this add-on). I get the idea but it's wrong. Visiting Facebook, then entering a different URL, will keep you in the Facebook container. Track-track-track. Just too much concentration and handling is needed to keep things real secure. For now this extension is just a kind of identity switcher within the same Firefox user-profile. Why not then just create an add-on to switch to another user-profile with a toolbar drop down-menu? At least that's clear and transparent. This surely isn't! For this to work properly you've to create a container for every URL/cluster of sites you visit. We need Firefox Web Clusters/Containers.\n\nEDIT 2: Found out that sites are currently not even linked to containers (only cache/cookie data) which was not my assumption. It starts your selected container and stores data in that container separating data from other containers. The problem here is that selecting a default container for a specific site results in not being able to switch accounts for that specific site. A contradicting (dis)function. \n\nAbstract/R√©sum√©:\n- You can switch profiles by selecting containers in the toolbar-button (entering the URL again)\n- Ones assigned to a specific default container, you can't switch profiles\n- You'll need to be careful entering websites you're not willing to have in the container since this enables tracking *\n- To protect you from tracking you'll need (an) extension(s) that isolates Facebook, etc. from all other containers **\n\n* You'll notice you're logged off from web sites (don't log in but start a new container). This extension is (not) for dummies.\n** There's a Facebook container that doesn't work i.c.w. other forks (Google, Twitter, etc.). Also you can't switch profiles.\n\nEDIT 3: For a workable solution install these extra add-ons\n\n- Switch Container (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switch-container/)\n\n- Temporary Containers (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/)\n\nMoz://FifthAxiom","created":"2020-01-09T09:02:06Z","score":1},{"body":"This extension worked fine for me before.

It's like having 2+ browsers within a single window. You can log into two different email accounts within the same window! You can open up two Amazon.com accounts via two different colored Containers! It's so awesome! User Interface Power to the MAX! \n\nPersonal Example: I have like 8 gmail accounts and it's a hassle to log into each account and check them via PC browsers (Thank goodness for the mobile gmail app, but sometimes you just gotta view an email from a PC). But with Firefox containers, I can easily open all 8 gmail accounts, each within it's own container. For example: my first, main gmail opens in a blue container. My second, secondary gmail opens in a red container. My third, junk email opens in a yellow container. I literally press the containers button, pick a color, open a new tap in said color, type in gmail.com or press the home button, and (since I have Firefox remember my passwords to my gmail accounts) it automatically loads just that email (for that color). In essence, I can check all 3 emails within a single browser window. Containers is convenient! \n\nTechnical Note: I've streamlined getting to my emails faster. I use another Firefox Quantum add-on, \"New Tab Override\" by Soren Hentzschel to actually get Firefox Quantum to automatically open a new tab specifically assigned to https://mail.google.com/. Now I can just: pick a container color (blue, red, yellow) and open a \"new tab\" in said color, and with \"New Tab Override,\" I'm automatically redirected to https://mail.google.com/ . Yes, every time I open a new tab I'm redirected to https://mail.google.com/ but now I no longer have to type \"gmail.com\" into the url bar nor press the home button to load gmail for each of my container colors. That's 8 less clicks for me and I get to have Facebook be my homepage again!\n\nEdit: Be careful when first opening up Firefox Quantum. You won't be in any Container. Instead you will be in a colorless container a.k.a. normal Firefox browser/window/tabs (vanilla Firefox). If anything, I ask that the developers make it so I can start Firefox in a specific colored Container. Also be careful when opening up a new tab in Firefox Quantum, the default new tab is a vanilla tab so you must hold the + symbol to open a specifically colored new tab.","created":"2019-06-06T19:13:09Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-06-07T05:21:43Z","score":5},{"body":"This functionality is welcome.

I would wish for the possibility to map some pages and their subpages on a domain and/or subdomains to a different container. \n\nAn use case example is Wordpress. If making changes to a site it would be nice to have the backend in one container while the live site is in another. But after mapping the backend to \"work\" container the site also always opens in \"work\" and vice versa. Of course I can temporally choose another container, but making this permanently changes it for the whole domain and not only the page and its subpages.\n\nAn good example how this could work better is \"Dark Background and Light Text\" (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text)\n\nAnyhow, thanks for this marvelous addon.","created":"2019-03-15T16:58:00Z","score":4},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-15T20:34:33Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-17T14:46:46Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-18T09:24:08Z","score":5},{"body":"Excellente id√©e, il ne manque plus que les containers soient synchronis√©s sur le compte Firefox pour que cela soit parfait.","created":"2019-03-18T13:33:00Z","score":5},{"body":"Very handy when you need to connect to the same site concurrently with different authentications","created":"2019-03-18T18:11:31Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-18T18:30:36Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-05T02:01:49Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-05T06:49:35Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2019-03-05T17:00:21Z","score":5},{"body":"–ù—É–∂–Ω–∞ —Å–∏–Ω—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è –∏ –±—ç–∫–∞–ø –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–∫. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —á—Ç–æ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ 4-–∫—É, –µ—Å—Ç—å –∫ —á–µ–º—É —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–∏—Ç—å—Å—è. –ï—Å–ª–∏ –Ω–µ —É–≤–∏–∂—É —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥–æ–¥–∞, —Å–Ω–∏–∂—É –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫—É.","created":"2019-03-05T17:40:24Z","score":4},{"body":"Must-have extension for Firefox.

There's two or three things I would love to see updated for containers that would definitely earn that last star though: switching a tab to new containers from either no container or a different container (one at a time or en masse), as this would allow first time container users who hoard tabs to move them over a little more easily; the ability to shift around containers (i.e. move up a container that's in constant use up, or move one that I don't really care for down), as currently the only way to \"move\" them is by deleting the container and then making it again which puts it at the bottom of the list; and if you could make it so that tabs in a closed container (or open for that matter) would sync with firefox sync (and the containers themselves!). These changes are the only things getting in the way of this being from my perspective the ultimate tab sorter.\n\nContainers has honestly helped me organize my online activity and helped me put my distractions into a side tab, though; so I honestly say this is one of, if not the, best add-on on Firefox, which is (in my incredibly biased and tab-hoarding opinion) the best internet browser.","created":"2018-07-12T19:33:17Z","score":4},{"body":null,"created":"2018-07-12T19:49:53Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2018-07-12T20:19:09Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2018-07-13T00:28:44Z","score":5},{"body":"wow love wish i had this yr's A GO NOW I HAVE ms. it,s slow me down i well tell      all i can and tell to pass it on if was old man  that fell in a gold mine make fell like landing  Down  cry Tell All  FireFOX is the way to go","created":"2018-07-13T05:34:03Z","score":4},{"body":"Brilliant add-on, a must for multi-tenancy cloud admins.","created":"2018-07-13T08:07:13Z","score":5},{"body":null,"created":"2018-07-13T08:08:58Z","score":2},{"body":"I really appreciate this extension!
